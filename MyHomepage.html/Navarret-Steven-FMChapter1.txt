Steven Navarrete -Chapter 1
What I got from reading chapter one is that information systems are made up of different software and hardware components that all collectively gather, process, store,
and redistribute data. The hardware components of the information systems include the things the user can physically touch like the keyboard or computer screens.
However, the software components of the information systems include sets of instructions that directs what the hardware does. Software programs are really just a list 
of instructions that tell the computer what to do. In addition, data plays a vital role in the effectiveness of information systems because if organized and indexed 
correctly data can become a useful intrument businesses could use to uphold any agenda in mind. Ever since the late 1950s and 1960s, computers have gone a long way.
They evolved from being refrigerator-sized monsters used for great amounts of calculations to personalized internet surfers. As computers became less and less
expensive due to the increasing number of computer companies pumping out their own versions of the PC, businesses realized a need for their computers to share
information with one another thus began the implementation of LAN and the Internet. During this implementation of a shared network among multiple computers paved the
way for the establishment of the World Wide Web and with this the average PC would soon become more of a communications device than a computational device. And with
the installment of the World Wide Web came the era of globalization where businesses around the globe would market their products and services through the
internet in order to expand their clientbase and potentially increase annual earnings. The internet was viewed by many investers as a sort of digital gold mine because
of how much potential for profit and success the internet can offer to those who can take advantage of its easy access.
